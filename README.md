# MagTrain
Code to run the Arduino Magnetometer Train: Salty

A toy train and an arduino combine to collect data around scale models of geophysical magnetic anomalies. Using an LSM9DS1, we can see the model magnetic signatures of dikes, ocean stripes, and the Earth's field as a whole. Check out the full story here:

This repository contains three sketches to run with Arduino:

1) Reading LSM9DS1 and with no train input

2) Reading LSM9DS1 while the train is on

3) Reading LSM9DS1 and controlling the train with an IR remote
